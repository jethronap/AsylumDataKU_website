# Analysing Asylum Data and Practices in Denmark

Analysing data from the public data set of the **Danish Refugee Appeals Board (Flygtningenævnet)**. All data for this analysis is being gathered from the database of **Flygtningenævnet** and can be reached [here](https://fln.dk/da/Praksis).

### Our case:

> Databases and algorithms are `not self-explanatory` and the case of **Flygtningenævnet** shows how our research team came across a category `Unknown Homeland (Ukendt hjemland)` without appropriate a-priory explanations.

In this project various text mining techniques and natural language processing have been implemented in order to:

- Extract data from a dataset that was created after scraping the website of the Danish Appeals Board (Flygtningenævnet)
- Discover latent information inside the appeal texts through the use of Topic Modelling algorithms and other NLP techniques, such as N-gram and TF-IDF analysis.
- Showcase how **Natural Language Processing** can be a method for getting into practices that potential shape people's lives.

However, trying to work with `NLP` in a critical way our research team points out the need for some kind of collaborative action and processes which would require a `human-in-the-loop` set up. This way meaningful information can be extracted and also this could be a more fruitful exposure of the infrastructural condition that shape and make of of datasets like the one we are looking into here.  

> This project is being realized at [Confronting Data Lab](https://www.confrontingdata.dk) @ DIKU.
