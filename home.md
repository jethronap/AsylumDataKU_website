# Analysing Asylum Data and Practices in Denmark

Analysing data from the public data set of the Danish Appeals Board (Flygtningenævnet). All data for this analysis is being gathered from the database of **Flygtningenævnet** and can be reached [here](https://fln.dk/da/Praksis).

In this project various text mining techniques and natural language processing have been implemented in order to:

- Extract data from a dataset that was created after scraping the website of the Danish Appeals Board (Flygtningenævnet)
- Discover latent information inside the appeal texts through the use of Topic Modelling algorithms and other NLP techniques, such as N-gram and TF-IDF analysis.

This website is a presentation of some theoretical aspects that fuelled the analysis and the results of the analysis per se.

> This project is being realized at Confronting Data Lab @ DIKU.
