# N-gram analysis:

**N-grams** are neighboring sequences of items (words, letters, symbols) in a document.

Most of the times a probability is assigned to the occurrence of a N-gram (or a word occurring next in a sequence of words). This can help decide which N-grams can be chunked together to form single entities or make predictions for next words (other possible use cases include spelling corrections).

[Here](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/slides/LM_4.pdf), are some slides from Stanford which provide an introduction to N-gram models and the math that goes with it.
