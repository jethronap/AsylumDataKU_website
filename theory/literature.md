# Minor literature review

In this project we saw how the *objectivity* of data is a completely *subjective* construct. Such a realization exposed a major problem about making such data *open* when this type of data are misleading. This is when we arrive at `open data without context`.

This research project tries to identify the interplay between and constructing and using data and the multiple ways the *use* of data *constructs* data, as well. `NLP` provided us with an affluent tool to inquire into those data.
