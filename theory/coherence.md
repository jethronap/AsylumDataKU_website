# Coherence Score

Compute the coherence score is essentially a measure of how similar the words assigned to each topic are in terms of semantic value. The higher the score, the better.

Compute the coherence score for LDA models with 2 to 10 topics and see which number of topics leads to the highest coherence score.

Topic coherence in essence measures the human interpretability of a topic model. Traditionally perplexity has been used to evaluate topic models however this does not correlate with human annotations at times. Topic coherence is another way to evaluate topic models with a much higher guarantee on human interpretability. Thus this can be used to compare different topic models among many other use-cases.
