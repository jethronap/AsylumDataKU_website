# Analysing Asylum Data and Practices in Denmark.

In this project various text mining techniques and natural language processing have been implemented in order to:

- Extract data from a dataset that was created after scraping the website of the Danish Appeals Board (Flygtningen√¶vnet)
- Discover latent information inside the appeal texts through the use of Topic Modelling algorithms and other NLP techniques, such as N-gram and TF-IDF analysis.

This website is a presentation of some theoretical aspects that fuelled the analysis and the results of the analysis per se.

## Website contents:

Under **Theory** tab you can see some insights regarding:
- N-gram analysis.
- TF-IDF analysis.
- Topic modelling algorithms used, especially LDA, NMF, LSI.

Under **Analysis** tab you can see:
- Results from text mining and exploratory analysis of text regarding to case that we marked as Unknown Homeland and all other cases.
- The topics produced after implementing LDA, NMF and LSI.

Under **People** tab you can see some infos about all the beautifull persons involved in the project.
